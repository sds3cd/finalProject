CS 4414 Final Project
__________________
ABOUT OUR PROJECT:

For our final OS project, we created a hangman website with multiple difficulty levels and playing styles. We originally coded a terminal version of the game in Rust, which we demoed in office hours.  We had initially planned on adding graphics using a Rust library; however, after meeting we decided creating a webpage would better enhance the game.  We believe our project satisfies the requirements of relevant to lecture, technically useful, and fun.  Both of us were new to JavaScript and had little experience in HTML and CSS.  We had fun coding it, and hope you have fun playing it!

HOW TO PLAY:

This repository includes two versions of our hangman game: one implemented in Rust and one implemented using HTML and JavaScript. 

You can download both games by cloning our repository on GitHub:

	git clone https://github.com/sds3cd/finalProject.git

The Rust version of hangman is terminal based.    Please note that the game was created using version Rust 0.8 and will only compile if you are running the same version on our machine.  To play the Rust version, run the following commands in the terminal in the /finalProject directory:

- make
  
- ./hang

The HTML version of the game is run using a file URI scheme.  The web address will depend on where you cloned our directory to.  To play the web version of the game, enter the following in your browser window: 

	file:/// <directory to which you cloned our code> /finalProject/home.html
